/**
 * {@code @ExcludeBean} excludes a bean, or multiple beans, that include a bean defining annotation
 * (e.g. scope) from automatic discovery. This can be helpful to allow replacing a bean class with a different
 * implementation, typically a mock or stub.
 *
 * <p>The type of bean to exclude is implied by the annotated fields' type or annotated methods' return type. If the type
 * is a base class or interface all beans extending / implementing that type will be excluded.
 *
 * <p>NOTE: This annotation will only exclude beans defined by class annotations. It will not exclude beans of the
 * implied type that are defined by {@link Produces} producer methods / fields or synthetic
 * beans. Also, current implementation excludes beans based on type, disregarding any qualifiers that are specified.
 *
 * <p><b>Example:</b>
 * <pre>
 * &#64;EnableWeld(automagic = true)
 * class TestSomeFoo extends Specification {
 *   &#64;Inject
 *   SomeFoo someFoo        // SomeFoo depends upon application scoped bean Foo
 *
 *   &#64;Produces
 *   &#64;ExcludeBean           // Excludes beans with type Foo from automatic discovery
 *   Foo mockFoo = Mock()   // mockFoo is now produced in place of original Foo impl
 *
 *   def test(Foo myFoo) {
 *     expect:
 *       myFoo?.bar == 'mock-foo'
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
