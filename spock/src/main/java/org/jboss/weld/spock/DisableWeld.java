/**
 * An annotation with which Weld can be disabled on specification or feature level if it was
 * enabled globally or on specification level.
 *
 * <p>If Weld is enabled for a specification globally or by annotation with specification scope,
 * and disabled for a feature, there will still be the specification scoped Weld running during the
 * test and {@link Shared @Shared} fields injected from that instance, but the non-{@code @Shared}
 * fields, and parameters of {@code setup}, feature, and {@code cleanup} methods will not be injected.
 *
 * <p>On any class that is not a specification and on any method that is not a feature, this annotation
 * is simply ignored and has no effect.
 *
 * <p>If this annotation is applied on the same element as {@link EnableWeld @EnableWeld}, an exception
 * is thrown as it is unclear which should have precedence.
